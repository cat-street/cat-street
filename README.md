## Hi, I'm Andrey!

I'm a JavaScript developer from Moscow, Russia.

Photojournalist by education (no STEM background), previously I was working as a system administrator for many years, and started my journey to a web developer career in spring of 2020, by actively self-studying, applying to and finishing *Yandex Practicum* program, and consistently continuing to learn.

I'm proficient in **MERN** stack and **vanilla JS**, working with frontend and backend, writing clean code and following principles. Also interested in UX/UI and web design. Currently learning advanced React.

Cat lover and photographer in my free time. My interests are also include Japan, architecture, videogames, animation, classic and modern art.
