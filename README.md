## Hi, I'm Andrey!

I'm a JavaScript developer from Moscow, Russia.

Photojournalist by education (no STEM background), previously I was working as a system administrator for many years, and started my journey to a web developer career in spring of 2020, by actively self-studying, applying to *Yandex Practicum* program, and consistently continuing to learn.

I'm proficient in **MERN** stack and **vanilla JS**, writing clean and efficient code, working with frontend and backend. Also interested in UX/UI and web design.

Cat lover and photographer in my free time, I'm also volunteering as a photographer at the cat adoption center. My interests are also include Japan, architecture, videogames, animation, classic and modern art.
